| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| RowCardSection.jsx                  | Write the set interval as hooks    |
| TodaysVisitors.jsx                  | Change to hooks welkioGuestUpdater |
| VisitorCard.jsx                     | Change the load user data          |
